      "content": "In general, storing data in a file system is faster than storing it in SQLite, but it's important to note that there are many factors that can affect performance. \n\nIf you have a smaller amount of data or a small number of transactions, the difference in performance between the two methods is likely to be negligible. However, if you need to store and retrieve a large amount of data or perform frequent read/write operations, SQLite may be a better choice because it provides built-in indexing and locking mechanisms that can help improve performance.\n\nUltimately, the best choice depends on your specific requirements and use case for your PowerShell API wrapper. You can also perform some benchmark testing to determine which method works better for your specific scenario."
